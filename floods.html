      <pre>Above is my all-time favorite photograph.
It's been over a decade now, since. 

So much has changed.
Yet, at the same time, 
I'm not convinced <em>anything</em> has either.
You see, 

Life has a really silly way of coming back together, I want to be able to find that more often. 


Talking about the backstories of photographs feels like suddenly, life gets thrust into them. 
Speaking to the rest of the world, they can be transported there with you. Feeling the haptics all the same.

Even though I snapped it when I was 15, off a Canon T5 w/ a stock lens â€” the present from my Grandfather.
I made more use out of that camera than I could have ever hoped for in the moment.
