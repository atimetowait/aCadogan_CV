<br><br>
<pre>Above is my all time favorite photograph.
It's been over a decade now, since. 

So much has changed.
Yet, at the same time. 
I'm not convinced <em>anything</em> has either.

Life has a really silly way of coming back inwards. 
Or be it in, a forever circle. 

One that would never need to halt because, why would it want to? 


                            You decide!


  Speaking on the backstories of photographs feels as if new life gets thrust into them, & now suddenly, to the rest of the world...
This was all just taken the other day — who would <em>really </em>know?

Though, 
I snapped it when I was 15. 
Off a Canon T5 w/ a stock lens — a present from my Grandfather. 
I still remember the sound of the shutter on that particular day.
